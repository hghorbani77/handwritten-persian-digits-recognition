# Recognition of Handwritten Persian Digits using MLP Neural Network / تشخیص ارقام دست‌ نویس فارسی

## Description

In this project, a dataset of handwritten Persian digits has been identified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. In this repository, you can find the source code and results related to the training and evaluation of this neural network.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this exercise consists of 1,698 images of handwritten Persian digits from 0 to 9. This dataset is a subset of the comprehensive Hoda dataset (collected from the national university entrance exam in 2005 - 1384), which is provided in a folder named "Hoda_Dataset" along with other accompanying materials.

## Features

- Utilization of MLP for the recognition of handwritten Persian digits.
- Plotting the error curve during the training phases.
- Explanation of the maximum achieved accuracy in this project.
- Examination of accuracy in recognizing different digits.

## Contribution

We welcome any contributions and suggestions for improving this project. If you have ideas or enhancements, please create a new issue or send a pull request.
